The COVID-19 pandemic brought leisure and business air travel to a near-screeching halt in the second quarter of calendar year 2020. Fear of the coronavirus's transmissibility and lethality kept many Americans from boarding a plane in non-emergency situations. Additionally, domestic and international travel responses basically enforced an immediate ban on unnecessary travel. As one would expect, this has devastated the entire travel industry.  Experts propose that a full recovery could take upwards of 2.5 years. Smaller airlines may not have that much time to stay afloat; several regional airlines in the US and abroad have already folded. The US airline giants have felt a certain effect from flight cancellations, policy changes, and incurred costs for healthy safety measures. 

The purpose of this project is to analyze open-source metrics from the past five years to identify the potential for recovery amongst America's biggest airlines.
