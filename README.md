This research involves analysis of data from 2015-2020 in order to understand passenger
trends in commercial aviation. Data is open source and provided by the US Bureau of Transportation
Statistics (BTS). Revenue Passenger Miles, a key indicator of an airlineâ€™s operational
load, can be modeled as a time series. In this research, I provide insight on the forecast for
recovery amongst three leading US airline carriers in the post-COVID-19 environment. Autoregressive
with Integrated Moving Average models were generated in order to forecast expected
domestic Revenue Passenger Miles for three major US airlines. These forecasts provide valuable
insight to the air passenger revenue losses experienced in 2020 and the potential for a full
recovery in the industry.
